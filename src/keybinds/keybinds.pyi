    Registers a new keybind.

    If key or event are None, any key or event will be matched, and their values
    will be passed back to the callback. Therefore, based on these args, the
    callback is run with 0-2 arguments.

    The callback may return the sentinel `Block` type (or an instance thereof) in
    order to block normal processing of the key event.

    Args:
        key: The key to match, or None to match any.
        event: The key event to match, or None to match any.
        gameplay_bind: True if this keybind should only trigger during gameplay.

        An opaque handle to be used in calls to deregister_keybind.
